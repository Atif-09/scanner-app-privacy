      <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

      <p>Abma Tech built the Docs Scanner app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Abma Tech at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

      <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection and use of personal information if anyone decides to use our Service.</p>

      <p>If you choose to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>

      <p>While the Docs Scanner app itself does not collect any personal information or request permissions directly, it uses Google ML Kit Document Scanner, which requires access to your device's camera and gallery.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The SDK uses your camera to detect and scan physical documents. No images or data are stored or transmitted by the Docs Scanner app.</li>
        <li><strong>Gallery Access:</strong> If you choose to select an existing document from your gallery, the SDK requires access to your gallery. The app does not store or share this data.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All document processing is done locally on your device. The Docs Scanner app does not transmit, collect, or store any document data outside of the app.</p>

      <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p>

      <p>This Service does not address anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 18.</p>

      <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>

      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

      <p>This policy is effective as of 2024-10-24.</p>
